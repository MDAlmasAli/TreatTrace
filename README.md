## Latest Updates (2026-05-30)

**v0.42 — Restrict doctor access to test reports (view-only)**

- Doctors can no longer edit test reports — they can only view them
- Removed edit buttons from `patient_detail_screen` and `all_test_reports_screen`
- `TestReportDetailScreen` always opens with `canEdit: false` in doctor context
- Rationale: test reports are uploaded by patients; doctors should not modify them

**v0.41 — Rename: lab report → test report (full codebase + backend)**

- All Dart files, class names, file names, and identifiers renamed from `lab_report` / `LabReport` to `test_report` / `TestReport`
- Supabase DB table renamed `lab_reports` → `test_reports` (indexes, trigger, RLS policies all updated)
- New `test_reports` storage bucket created; new uploads go there; existing files remain accessible via the legacy `lab_reports` bucket
- `_deleteImageByUrl` now handles both buckets transparently
- Migration: `2026_05_30_v17_rename_lab_reports_to_test_reports.sql`

**v0.40 — Search by date (Prescriptions + Test Reports)**

- Calendar button beside the search bar on both screens
- Tapping opens a date picker; selected date shows as a removable chip
- Date filter combines with existing text search and category chips
- Active filter button highlights in the screen's accent colour

**v0.39 — Fix: document upload dialog stuck/hanging on Flutter Web**

- **Root cause**: Browser user-gesture context was lost between `await showDialog()` and `await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles()` — Chrome silently blocks file input clicks not originating from a live user gesture, causing `pickFiles()` to hang forever with no file dialog appearing
- **Fix**: Refactored all four upload screens so each dialog tile's `onTap` directly calls its own async handler (`_pickGallery`, `_pickCamera`, `_pickDocument`) in the same synchronous call stack as the tap, before any `await`; this preserves the browser's user gesture context
- **Affected screens**: `add_edit_prescription_screen`, `add_edit_lab_report_screen`, `doctor_write_prescription_screen`, `doctor_lab_report_screen`
- Removed intermediate `_UploadSource` enum dispatch pattern; replaced with direct callback-per-option approach

**v0.38 — Fix: document upload silently failing on Android**

- **Root cause**: `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles()` was called without `withData: true`; on Android (especially when picking from cloud storage like Google Drive), `file.path` can be a content URI that Supabase's `upload()` cannot access, and `file.bytes` was null because bytes were never loaded
- **Fix 1**: All four upload screens (`add_edit_lab_report`, `add_edit_prescription`, `doctor_lab_report`, `doctor_write_prescription`) now pass `withData: true` to `pickFiles()`, ensuring bytes are always loaded regardless of file source
- **Fix 2**: Both service `uploadDocument()` methods now check `file.bytes` first, fall back to `file.path`, and return null gracefully if neither is available — no more null assertion crashes
- **Fix 3**: `doctor_write_prescription_screen` document case now supports multiple file selection (was only picking the first file)

**v0.37 — File upload support for prescriptions and test reports**

- **PDF / DOC / DOCX upload** — both patients and doctors can now attach documents (not just images) to prescriptions and test reports
- **Upload dialog** extended with a third "Document" option alongside Gallery and Camera; uses `file_picker` to pick PDF, DOC, DOCX from device storage
- **PDF tile in upload card** — non-image attachments render as an amber icon tile (with file extension label) instead of a broken image thumbnail
- **Gallery detail screens updated** — `_ReportGallery`, `_PrescriptionGallery`, and the doctor prescription view now detect file type via `isImageUrl()`:
  - Image URLs → shown in the existing swipeable photo viewer / full-screen viewer
  - Document URLs → shown as a tappable document tile; tap opens the file in the device's default external browser via `url_launcher`
- Shared helper `lib/core/utils/file_utils.dart` (`isImageUrl`, `extFromUrl`) used across all screens for consistent file-type detection

**v0.36 — Linked Prescription is now tappable in Test Report detail**

- **Linked Prescription card is now tappable** — a right-arrow indicator appears on the card; tapping it fetches and opens the full prescription detail
- **Privacy-aware navigation**:
  - Patients open their own prescription in `PrescriptionDetailScreen` (editable as always)
  - Doctors open the prescription in `DoctorPrescriptionViewScreen`; edit is permitted only if `writtenByDoctorId == currentDoctorId`, so a doctor cannot edit another doctor's prescription but can view it
- Applied consistently across all four entry points: patient lab report list, patient global search, doctor patient detail, and doctor all-lab-reports screen

**v0.35 — Fix: test report edit fails with uuid error**

- **Root cause**: `AddEditLabReportScreen` hardcoded `userId: ''` (empty string) in the edit draft; on UPDATE `toMap()` sent `user_id = ""` to PostgreSQL which rejected it as an invalid UUID (code 22P02)
- **Fix 1**: In the edit path, `userId` now carries the existing report's `userId` instead of `""`
- **Fix 2**: `LabReportService.update()` strips `user_id` from the update payload — the owner of a report never changes after creation, so sending it was both unnecessary and risky
- The CREATE path was unaffected because `create()` always overrides `user_id` with `_uid`

**v0.34 — Remove global patient search for doctors**

- **`SearchPatientScreen` deleted** — global patient search is completely removed; doctors can no longer search for arbitrary patients in the system
- **"Add Patient" FAB removed** from My Patients screen — doctors can only view patients who are already linked to them
- **Notification tap** now opens Today's Schedule (appointment-relevant) instead of the removed patient search screen
- Doctors can only access patients they already have a link with

**v0.33 — All Test Reports screen with search & filters**

- **Show More on Test Reports** — Patient Details now shows the 5 most recent test reports; if there are more, a green "Show X more →" button opens the new `AllLabReportsScreen`
- **All Test Reports screen** — loads every test report for the patient with full search and filter support:
  - **Search** by test name or category (live, client-side)
  - **Date filter** chip — filters to a single test date with an inline × to clear
  - **Newest / Oldest sort** toggle
  - **Clear all** link resets both filters at once
  - **Result count** shows `filtered / total` when any filter is active
  - **View** (eye) button always visible; **Edit** (pencil) visible only for reports ordered by this doctor
- View and Edit navigate to existing `LabReportDetailScreen` / `DoctorLabReportScreen` and reload on return

**v0.32 — Remove time field from appointments + show notes in schedule tile**

- **Time field removed** from both patient-facing (`AddEditAppointmentScreen`) and doctor-facing (`DoctorAddAppointmentScreen`) appointment forms; `appointmentTime` is always saved as `null` for new appointments
- **Notes now visible on schedule tile** — appointment `notes` text appears below the visit reason in every `_ScheduleTile` in Today's Schedule, with a notes icon and muted style to distinguish it from the primary reason

**v0.31 — Search bar in My Patients screen**

- **Live search bar** — filters the patient list in real-time as the doctor types; matches against full name, username (`@handle`), and phone number
- **Match highlighting** — the matching portion of the name/username/phone is highlighted in accent colour with a subtle background tint
- **Username shown on tile** — `@username` now appears alongside the phone number on each patient card (fetched from `profiles.username`)
- **Filtered count** — header badge shows `matched / total` when a search is active
- **No-results state** — distinct empty state with search-off icon when the query returns nothing
- `DoctorPatientLink` model and `_attachPatientProfiles` updated to carry `patientUsername`

**v0.30 — Search & sort in All Prescriptions screen**

- **Search by diagnosis / medicine** — live text search bar filters the list as the doctor types; matches against diagnosis field and medicine names
- **Filter by date** — date chip opens a date picker; selected date is shown as a highlighted chip with an inline × to clear; shows only prescriptions from that consultation date
- **Sort toggle** — "Newest ↓ / Oldest ↑" chip toggles sort order with a single tap
- **Clear all** — "Clear" link appears when any filter is active and resets everything at once
- **Result count** — shows `filtered / total` when a filter is active so the doctor can see how many records match
- **No-results state** — separate empty state for "no results" (search icon) vs "no prescriptions" (medication icon)
- All filtering is client-side on the already-loaded list — no extra network calls

**v0.29 — Multi-image select from Gallery for prescriptions and test reports**

- **Gallery now supports multi-select** — tapping Gallery opens the native multi-image picker; all selected images are uploaded sequentially and added to the form
- **Camera remains single-shot** — camera path unchanged, still picks one photo at a time
- Applies to all 4 upload screens: doctor prescription, doctor lab report, patient prescription, patient test report

**v0.28 — Fix: appointment not moving to Completed after prescription save**

- **Root cause**: `appointments` table had a SELECT policy for doctors (v07) but no UPDATE policy — `updateStatus()` was silently blocked by RLS; the `catch (_) {}` hid the error so the appointment stayed `scheduled`
- **Fix**: Added `doctor_updates_own_appointment` UPDATE policy (USING + WITH CHECK on `doctor_user_id = auth.uid()`) and `patient_updates_own_appointment` policy for patient-side cancellations
- **Database migration v16**

**v0.27 — Prescription View screen + Edit History + Show More**

- **View button on every prescription** — doctors can now tap View (eye icon) to open a read-only Prescription screen showing diagnosis, medicines, notes, and images; Edit button in the header opens the edit screen from there
- **Edit button stays** — green edit icon visible only for prescriptions the doctor wrote themselves; View is available for all prescriptions regardless of author
- **Edit History section** — every prescription now shows a date-wise log at the bottom; each unique calendar day of create/edit appears once (same-day repeated edits collapse into one entry); entries show Created or Edited badge
- **Auto-log on create/edit** — `DoctorWritePrescriptionScreen._save()` now upserts a row in `prescription_edit_logs` with today's date; `ON CONFLICT (prescription_id, action_date) DO NOTHING` prevents duplicates
- **Show More → All Prescriptions screen** — Patient Details shows the 5 most recent prescriptions; if there are more, a "Show X more →" button opens `AllPrescriptionsScreen` which loads and lists all prescriptions with View + Edit per tile
- **Database migration v15** — `prescription_edit_logs` table with RLS; unique constraint on `(prescription_id, action_date)`

**v0.26 — Auto-add patient to My Patients after prescription**

- **Patient auto-linked after prescription save** — when a doctor writes a new prescription from Today's Schedule, the patient is automatically added to the doctor's "My Patients" list with `status = accepted` (no manual request/accept flow needed)
- **Idempotent upsert** — if the link already exists as accepted, nothing changes; if it was pending/rejected, it is upgraded to accepted
- **SECURITY DEFINER function** — `auto_link_appointment_patient(p_patient_id)` handles the upsert with elevated privileges; guards against abuse by verifying the caller has an appointment with the patient via `doctor_has_appointment_with()`
- **Database migration v14** — adds the `auto_link_appointment_patient` function

**v0.25 — Today's Schedule: Completed tab + auto-complete on Rx save**

- **New "Completed" tab in Today's Schedule** — third filter chip alongside Today and Upcoming; shows all completed appointments sorted most-recent-first
- **Auto-mark appointment as completed** — when a doctor writes and saves a new prescription for a patient opened from Today's Schedule, that appointment's status is automatically set to `completed` and moves out of the Today/Upcoming list into the Completed tab
- **Today/Upcoming tabs now exclude completed** — only `scheduled` appointments appear in Today and Upcoming, so the list stays clean after each consultation
- **Date shown on Completed tiles** — appointment date is displayed on each completed card (same as Upcoming)
- **Schedule reloads on return** — navigating back from Patient Details always refreshes the list to reflect any status changes

**v0.24 — Fix doctor prescription save RLS**

- **Fixed "Failed to save" when doctor writes prescription from Today's Schedule** — the `doctor_inserts_patient_rx` INSERT policy only allowed doctors to write prescriptions for patients in their `doctor_patient_links` (accepted), but not for appointment-only patients; updated policy now also permits insert when `doctor_has_appointment_with(user_id)` is true
- **Fixed doctor unable to edit prescriptions they wrote** — no UPDATE policy existed for doctors; added `doctor_updates_own_written_rx` policy so doctors can update any prescription where `written_by_doctor_id = auth.uid()`
- **Database migration v13** — recreates `doctor_inserts_patient_rx` and adds `doctor_updates_own_written_rx` on `prescriptions` table

**v0.23 — Visiting Information section (Doctor home + public profile)**

- **New "Visiting Information" section on Doctor Home** — doctors can set Visiting Fee (BDT), Visiting Hours, and Chamber directly from their home screen via an Edit button; data is saved instantly with no admin review required
- **Visiting Fee moved out of Credentials** — removed from the credential submit/edit form and from the admin-reviewed flow entirely; now lives only in the Visiting Information section
- **Migration v12** — added `visiting_hours TEXT` and `chamber TEXT` columns to `doctor_verifications`; `visiting_fee` column already existed
- **Visiting Information shown on patient-facing Doctor Profile** — patients viewing a doctor's public profile now see a "Visiting Information" card with Fee, Hours, and Chamber (when set)
- **Swipe-to-delete on My Doctors list** — patients can swipe left on any doctor in their list to delete with a confirmation dialog
- **Delete button on Doctor Public Profile** — "Remove from My Doctors" outlined red button appears below "Take Appointment" when the doctor is already in the patient's list

**v0.22 — Fix RLS circular reference (HTTP 500 on login)**

- **Fixed HTTP 500 on `fetchProfile()`** — the v10 RLS policies created a circular reference: `profiles → appointments → profiles` (via `doctor_reads_by_name_snapshot`), causing a 500 error on every profile read for doctor accounts; this broke login routing and role selection on Chrome (web) and anywhere the doctor tried to log in
- **Fix: SECURITY DEFINER function** — replaced the raw `EXISTS (SELECT ... FROM appointments)` subquery inside profiles/health_profiles/prescriptions/lab_reports policies with a call to `doctor_has_appointment_with(uuid)` — a `SECURITY DEFINER` function that reads `appointments` bypassing its own RLS, breaking the cycle
- **Database migration v11** — creates `doctor_has_appointment_with()` function and recreates all 4 appointment-patient RLS policies to use it
- **Fixed VS Code launch config** — replaced the generic Chrome URL launcher in `.vscode/launch.json` with proper `dart` type Flutter launch configs; "Run Without Debugging" now correctly starts the Flutter dev server instead of opening a dead `localhost:8080`
- **Fixed `_loadRole` silent swallow** — `fetchMyVerification()` errors are now caught in their own inner try-catch so a verification fetch failure no longer incorrectly shows the role selection screen

**v0.21 — Fix doctor RLS for appointment patients**

- **Fixed patient name showing "Patient"** in Today's Schedule — `profiles` RLS was blocking doctors from reading profiles of patients who booked appointments without being linked; new policy `doctor_reads_appt_patient_profile` added
- **Fixed Patient Details all-empty** — added RLS policies on `health_profiles`, `prescriptions`, `lab_reports` so doctors can read data for appointment-based patients (not just linked ones)
- **Database migration v10** — 4 new SELECT policies covering `profiles`, `health_profiles`, `prescriptions`, `lab_reports` for any patient with an appointment with the doctor

**v0.20 — Patient Details UI fix**

- **Removed "Add Appointment" button** from Patient Details screen bottom bar — only "Write Prescription" remains

**v0.19 — Doctor Full Profile Page**

- **Full-page doctor profile screen** — replaced the old bottom sheet popup with a dedicated `DoctorPublicProfileScreen`; shows doctor photo (large hero), name, specialty, visiting fee badge, hospital, degree, email, and "About" paragraph in a scrollable full-page layout
- **Accessible from three places** — opens from (1) global doctor search results, (2) patient's "My Doctors" list when tapping any saved doctor that has a Supabase sourceId, (3) patient's "Linked Doctors" list when tapping any linked doctor
- **Action buttons retained** — "Add to My Doctors" (green) and "Take Appointment" (accent blue) are on the profile page with the same logic as before
- **Service method added** — `fetchDoctorPublicProfile(doctorId)` in `DoctorPatientLinkService` fetches combined `profiles` + `doctor_verifications` data for a single doctor in parallel

**v0.18 — Doctor Visiting Fee + Admin Pending Edits Fix**

- **Visiting Fee field added** — required field on doctor signup and credentials edit screen; stored in `doctor_verifications.visiting_fee` (INTEGER, BDT); pending edit stored in `pending_visiting_fee`; shown with green badge in credentials view
- **Fee shown in patient-facing search** — `fetchApprovedDoctors()` now returns `visiting_fee`; displayed as green "BDT X" row in doctor search result tiles
- **Admin panel shows visiting fee** — appears in both the verification review card and the pending-edit diff view
- **Fixed admin "Edits (0)" bug** — `fetchPendingEdits()` was using an embedded `profiles(...)` join which PostgREST was silently dropping rows for (inner-join behavior on filtered queries); fixed by separating into two queries
- **Fixed `approve_doctor_edit` RPC** — now also copies `degree`, `about`, `visiting_fee` when approving edits
- **Database migration v09** — adds `visiting_fee`, `pending_visiting_fee`; recreates `approve_doctor_edit` with full field set

---

**v0.17 — Doctor Degree & About Myself Fields**

- **Degree field added** — required field on both the initial verification submit screen and the credentials edit screen; stored in `doctor_verifications.degree`; pending edit stored in `pending_degree`
- **About Myself field added** — required field on both forms; multi-line; stored in `doctor_verifications.about`; pending edit stored in `pending_about`
- **Admin panel updated** — Degree and About now shown in both the verification review card and the pending-edit diff view
- **Database migration v08** — added `degree`, `about`, `pending_degree`, `pending_about` columns to `doctor_verifications`

---

**v0.16 — Doctor Appointment Notifications + Patient Requests Section**

- **Real-time appointment notifications** — when a patient books an appointment the doctor's app receives a Supabase Realtime event; a local push notification fires immediately with the patient's name and appointment date; tapping the notification navigates the doctor directly to the Search Patient screen to send a link request
- **`showAppointmentNotification()` added to `ReminderService`** — dedicated `doctor_appointments` notification channel (high importance); static `onNotificationTapped` callback wired in `DoctorHomeScreen` so taps navigate correctly; `getLaunchPayload()` handles cold-start launches from notification tray
- **Patient Requests section on Doctor Home** — new section below Quick Actions listing all pending outgoing link requests the doctor has sent; each tile shows patient avatar, name, phone, and "Pending" amber badge; tapping navigates to Search Patient; empty state shown when no pending requests
- **Test Reports removed from Doctor Home quick actions** — section was redundant (accessed via My Patients → Patient Detail); replaced Write Prescription with a full-width card
- **Supabase Realtime subscription** — `doctor_home_screen` subscribes to `appointments` INSERT filtered by `doctor_user_id = uid`; channel cleaned up on dispose

---

**v0.15 — Doctor Today's Schedule Fix**

- **Today's Schedule now shows appointments correctly** — doctors can see all appointments booked under their name from the doctor portal; root cause was `doctor_user_id = null` on existing appointments combined with RLS blocking the name-snapshot fallback query
- **New RLS policy `doctor_reads_by_name_snapshot`** — added to `appointments` table; allows a doctor to read any appointment where `doctor_name_snapshot ILIKE their profile full_name`; acts as a permanent safety net for appointments where `doctor_user_id` is not set
- **`doctor_user_id` backfilled** — all existing appointments where `doctor_name_snapshot` exactly matches a doctor's `profiles.full_name` (case-insensitive) have been updated to set `doctor_user_id` to that doctor's UUID; primary query path (`doctor_user_id = uid`) now returns results directly

---

**v0.14 — Global Doctor Search + UI Fixes**

- **Global search now finds all approved doctors** — any patient can search for any doctor in the system by name or hospital; results show "My Doctor" badge (green) if already linked, or "Doctor" badge (blue) if not; previously only manually added doctors from the `doctors` table were searchable
- **Doctor profile bottom sheet on tap** — tapping a doctor in search results shows a modal sheet with avatar, name, hospital, and "Linked Doctor" badge; "Save to My Doctors" button creates a record in the `doctors` table and navigates to `DoctorDetailScreen`
- **`fetchApprovedDoctors()` added to `DoctorPatientLinkService`** — fetches all `profiles` with `role = 'doctor'` joined with `doctor_verifications` where `status = 'approved'`; both linked status and full doctor list loaded in parallel
- **"Last Prescribed" button wired up** — bottom bar button on the home screen (patient) now navigates to the Prescriptions screen; was previously a no-op (`onTap: null`)
- **"Add Doctor" FAB restored** — `FloatingActionButton.extended` restored in "My Doctors" screen; since patients can't initiate links (doctors do), tap now shows an info dialog explaining how to get linked

---

## v0.13 Updates (2026-05-25)

**v0.13 — Username System + Signup Fix + Codebase Cleanup**

- **Unique username for all users** — every account (patient & doctor) has a `@username`:
  - `profiles.username` column: unique, format `[a-z0-9_]`, 3–20 characters, nullable (existing accounts)
  - `check_username_available(uname)` Supabase RPC (SECURITY DEFINER) — bypasses RLS for safe availability check
  - `search_patient_by_query` RPC updated to return `username` in results
- **Signup screen** — username field added with 500 ms real-time availability check (green ✓ / red ✗ indicator); `FilteringTextInputFormatter` restricts input to allowed characters; username saved to `profiles` via auth metadata trigger
- **Profile screen** — `@username` shown below email in the profile header; "Change Username" tile added to Account Settings with in-dialog availability check
- **Search Patient screen** — hint text and no-result message updated to mention @username; result card shows `@username` below phone
- **Signup "Failed to fetch" fix** — SMTP delay (3–4 s) caused the Flutter client to timeout before the server responded, showing "Failed to fetch"; catch block now detects network errors and shows a "Check your email" confirmation dialog instead of retrying (which previously invalidated the OTP token)
- **RLS circular dependency fix** — previous "Doctor profiles readable" policy queried `doctor_verifications`, which had a policy querying `profiles` → infinite recursion → `fetchProfile()` threw → `_role` stayed null → role picker reappeared after restart; fixed by using `USING (role = 'doctor')` with no cross-table joins
- **Removed `public_doctors`** — dropped dead `public_doctors` Supabase table (12 stale rows never read by the app); deleted `PublicDoctor` model, `PublicDoctorService`, `DiscoverDoctorsScreen`; removed all references from `global_search_screen`, `doctors_screen`, `linked_doctors_screen`
- `dart analyze` passes clean across all changed files

---

## v0.12 Updates (2026-05-24)

**v0.12 — Doctor Prescription Images + Linked Doctor Picker + Bug Fixes**

- **Doctor prescription image upload** — doctor-written prescriptions now support image attachments (camera + gallery); images stored in Supabase Storage `prescriptions` bucket and shown in prescription detail
- **Full timing labels in doctor prescription** — dose slot labels use full words (Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night) instead of icon-only, matching the patient-side prescription form
- **Patient image visibility** — patients can now view prescription images written by their linked doctor; previously images were visible only to the writer
- **Linked doctor picker in prescription form** — "Doctor Name" field in patient's Add/Edit Prescription now shows autocomplete suggestions from accepted linked doctors (fetched from `doctor_patient_links`); selecting a doctor auto-fills name, specialty, and hospital from their verified `doctor_verifications` record
- **Linked doctor picker in test report form** — same autocomplete behaviour in patient's Add/Edit Test Report; selecting a doctor fills name and stores `ordered_by_doctor_id`
- **New medicine added at top of list** — in the doctor prescription screen, newly added medicines appear at position 0 (top of list) instead of appended at the bottom
- **Doctor credentials edit** — fixed RLS policy that blocked updates to `doctor_verifications`; fixed `_saving` state not resetting after save, preventing the save button from re-enabling
- **Test report bug fixes** — MIME type detection corrected for HEIC/WebP images; camera permission granted flow fixed; `test_date` now required before saving; doctor portal image upload error resolved
- `dart analyze` passes clean across all changed files

---

## v0.11 Updates (2026-05-23)

**v0.11 — Doctor-Linked Test Reports + Full Doctor View Access**

- **Test Report renamed throughout doctor portal** — "Lab Report / Lab Order" renamed to "Test Report" across all doctor-facing screens (`DoctorLabReportScreen`, `PatientDetailScreen` section header)
- **Doctor → Patient Detail: all test reports tappable** — any test report in a patient's file now opens a full read-only detail view (category, date, doctor name, notes, uploaded images); previously only the edit button was shown for own reports with no way to view others
- **Edit access scoped by `ordered_by_doctor_id`** — green ✏️ edit button appears only on reports where `ordered_by_doctor_id == currentDoctorId`; all other reports are view-only with full content visible
- **Patient → Add Test Report: test name field removed** — category now serves as the report identifier; `test_name` is auto-derived from the selected category on save; custom category dialog retained for non-preset types
- **Doctor autocomplete in patient's test report form** — "Doctor Name" field now shows suggestions from the patient's accepted linked doctors (fetched from `doctor_patient_links`); selecting a doctor stores their UUID in `ordered_by_doctor_id`, granting them edit access to that report from their patient view
- **`ordered_by_doctor_id` settable by patients** — patients can now link one of their My Doctors to a self-uploaded test report; the linked doctor immediately sees the edit button on that report in the patient detail screen
- **RLS confirmed** — `doctor_reads_patient_labs` SELECT policy already covers doctors viewing linked patient reports; `doctor_updates_own_lab_order` UPDATE policy enforces the edit scope
- `dart analyze` passes clean across all changed files

**v0.10 — Plus Jakarta Sans Font + Animated Splash Screen**

- **Bundled font** — Plus Jakarta Sans variable TTF added to `assets/fonts/`; registered at weights 400/500/600/700 in `pubspec.yaml`; loads instantly offline with no network dependency
- **App theme migrated** — `app_theme.dart` fully rewritten to use `fontFamily: 'PlusJakartaSans'`; removed all `GoogleFonts.poppins(...)` calls from the theme layer; both light and dark `ThemeData` now apply Plus Jakarta Sans as the default
- **Animated splash screen** — replaced the static image splash with a "Clarity Reveal" sequence:
  - Location-pin scales in from 0.6× → 1.0× with `easeOutBack` over 600 ms
  - White ECG/heartbeat line draws itself left→right inside the pin over 700 ms
  - "TreatTrace" wordmark revealed by an expanding `ClipRect` wipe left→right over 750 ms ("Treat" in `#136AFB`, "Trace" in `#0B3D8C`)
  - Tagline "Your health, traced." fades in softly after the wordmark
  - Brand-blue circular progress indicator at bottom while the app finishes initialising
- **Minimum display guarantee** — `AuthGate` enforces a 2 500 ms floor so the full animation always plays even when the Supabase session check resolves instantly
- Role-loading screen (`_RoleAwareRouter`) now shows a plain white + spinner rather than restarting the splash animation
- `flutter analyze` passes clean

---

## v0.9 Updates (2026-05-22)

**v0.9 — Doctor Portal + Role-Based Routing**

- **Role Selection screen** — shown on first login; user picks *Patient* or *Doctor*; role saved to `profiles.role` in Supabase; never shown again once set
- **Doctor Home screen** — dedicated dashboard for doctor-role users with time-aware greeting, avatar, quick actions, and bottom nav
- **My Patients** — list of patients who have linked themselves to this doctor; tap to view their full health profile
- **Patient Detail** — doctors can view a patient's prescriptions, appointments, and health records from within the doctor portal
- **Search Patient** — doctors search for any registered patient by name/email and send a link request
- **Linked Doctors** — patient-side screen showing all doctors they are linked to; unlink option
- **Doctor Write Prescription** — doctor creates a prescription directly into a patient's account
- **Doctor Add Appointment** — doctor logs an appointment into a patient's timeline
- `doctor_patient_links` Supabase table with RLS; patients see only their own links, doctors see only their linked patients
- `AuthGate` → `_RoleAwareRouter`: role fetched after login; routes to `HomeScreen` (patient) or `DoctorHomeScreen` (doctor); unset role triggers `RoleSelectionScreen`

**App Branding — Launcher Icons + In-App Logo**

- `flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.14.4` added to dev_dependencies
- **Android launcher icon** — standard `ic_launcher.png` generated in all density buckets (mdpi → xxxhdpi); adaptive icon (`mipmap-anydpi-v26`) with `#136AFB` solid background + transparent foreground pin

## Previous Updates (2026-05-21)

**v0.8 — DocTime-Style UI Overhaul**

- Entire app visual language redesigned to match DocTime (professional Bangladeshi healthcare app)
- **Single brand blue `#136AFB`** replaces the previous multi-colour feature accent system (purple / cyan / green / amber per module)
- **Light theme is now the default** — was previously `system` (often dark on most devices)
- `ThemeColors` centralised: `c.accent` = `#136AFB` in light mode, purple in dark mode; `c.purpleBright` / `c.cyan` alias to brand blue in light
- Removed `ShaderMask` gradient text ("Quick Actions" header was purple→cyan gradient)
- All coloured glow box-shadows (`DarkColors.X.withAlpha(N)`) replaced with neutral `Colors.black.withAlpha(small)`
- Splash screen rewritten to white/blue light theme (removed dark gradient)
- Fixed light-mode dialogs that were incorrectly rendering with dark card background
- All 22 Dart files updated; zero `DarkColors` hardcodes remain in feature screens

**v0.7 — Doctor Book + Appointment Log**

- **My Doctors** — personal doctor address book with name, specialty, hospital, chamber address, phone, fee, notes; favorites toggle (heart icon)
- **Appointments** — full appointment log with 3-tab view (Upcoming / Past / Cancelled); status management (Mark Completed / Cancel)
- Doctor and Appointment screens linked: doctor detail screen shows all visits for that doctor; add appointment pre-fills the doctor
- `doctor_name_snapshot` preserves doctor name on appointments even if the doctor record is later deleted
- Home screen Quick Actions grid now shows **My Doctors** (green) and **Appointments** (amber) as live navigation cards
- Supabase tables: `doctors` + `appointments` with full RLS and `updated_at` triggers

**v0.6 — Test Report Viewer**

- **Test Reports** — upload lab results with category (Blood Test, X-Ray, MRI/CT, Ultrasound, ECG, Pathology, or custom), test date, referring doctor, lab/hospital, notes
- Multi-image upload per report (same pattern as prescriptions)
- Category filter chips on the list screen
- Optional prescription link — reports can reference an existing prescription
- Supabase table: `lab_reports` with `image_urls TEXT[]` and `prescription_id` nullable FK

- **Patient Detail** — full view of a patient's health profile, prescriptions, test reports, and appointments
  - **Test Reports** — all reports are tappable; opens full read-only detail (images, notes, category); green ✏️ edit button only when `ordered_by_doctor_id == doctorId`
  - **Prescriptions** — view all; edit button only when `written_by_doctor_id == doctorId`

- **Edit Test Report** — doctor can edit any test report they ordered or that the patient linked to them
- **Search Patient** — find any registered patient and establish a doctor–patient link
- **Doctor Write Prescription** — create a prescription directly into a patient's medical record; doctor info auto-filled from `doctor_verifications`
- **Doctor Add Appointment** — log an appointment into a patient's timeline
- Edit access scoped by `ordered_by_doctor_id` (test reports) and `written_by_doctor_id` (prescriptions) at both the UI layer and Supabase RLS layer
- RLS ensures doctors only see their own linked patients; patients see only their own links

### Username System
- Every account (patient & doctor) has a unique `@username`
- Format: lowercase letters, numbers, underscore only (`[a-z0-9_]`); 3–20 characters
- Set at sign-up with real-time availability indicator (500 ms debounce, green ✓ / red ✗)
- Displayed below email on the Profile screen header
- Changeable from Account Settings with in-dialog availability check
- Searchable in Search Patient screen (doctors find patients by @username)
- Stored in `profiles.username` with a unique index; `check_username_available` RPC enforces SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS

### Role-Based Routing
- **Role Selection screen** — shown once on first login; user picks Patient or Doctor
- Role saved to `profiles.role`; `_RoleAwareRouter` in `main.dart` routes accordingly
- Patients → `HomeScreen`; Doctors → `DoctorHomeScreen`; no role set → `RoleSelectionScreen`

### App Branding
- **Animated Clarity Reveal splash** — pin scale-in → ECG heartbeat draw → wordmark wipe → tagline fade; guaranteed ≥ 2 500 ms display
- Custom TreatTrace logo on Login screen and Signup screen header
- Launcher icons generated for Android (standard + adaptive `#136AFB` bg), iOS (22 sizes), Web (192/512 + maskable)
- App display name is "TreatTrace" on both Android and iOS home screens

### Typography
- **Plus Jakarta Sans** bundled at `assets/fonts/PlusJakartaSans.ttf` — weights 400, 500, 600, 700 registered in `pubspec.yaml`
- Loads instantly offline; no network font fetch at runtime
- Applied as the default font family across all light and dark theme text styles

### Theme & Localisation
- Full dark + light theme via `ThemeColors` extension on `BuildContext`; **light is the default**
- Single brand blue `#136AFB` in light mode; purple `#8B5CF6` in dark mode — both via `c.accent`
- All UI strings in English + Bangla via `S.of(context)` — switchable at runtime
